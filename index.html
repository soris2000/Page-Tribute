                <span class="stories-title">"V8 ENGINE INSPIRED BY DINO FERRARI"</span>
                <p class="stories-description">
                    Power came from a new 2.9-litre transversely mounted V8,
                     partly inspired by Enzo Ferrari’s son, Alfredo (‘Dino’). 
                     The power unit was known as the Ferrari Dino engine and kept powering GTB V8s,
                      with modifications, until the F430 of 2004. 
                      The bodies were initially made from lightweight glassfibre, the first (and only) 
                    Ferrari so equipped. Production later changed to steel and aluminium bodies.&nbsp; 
                    A targa-roof GTS followed in 1977.
